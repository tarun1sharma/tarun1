            <h1>THIS IS UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD </h1>
            <P>The University of Oxford is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England. There is evidence of
                teaching as early as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's
                second-oldest university in continuous operation. </P>

        <h1>COURSE WE OFFERS</h1>
        <P>Courses
            On our graduate course pages you'll find essential information about each department and the courses they
            offer, to help you to narrow your focus to a particular course.

            The University of Oxford is, and intends to remain, a thriving, cosmopolitan community of scholars and
            students united in our commitment to education and research. The departure from the EU will not change this;
            we are as committed as ever to welcoming the brightest students from all over the world for graduate study
            at Oxford.</P>

        <P>Things to see and do at Oxford University
            Oxford is not a campus university, so it is not all located on one site. It is made up of many different
            buildings, including academic departments, colleges and halls, located around the centre of Oxford. Many
            University buildings, such as gardens, libraries and museums, as well as many of the colleges, are open to
            visitors during the day, although please note that they may have varying opening hours, fees and rules for
            groups.</P>
